# Vue 3 Learning Project

This project was created as a practice to learn Vue 3 and its fundamentals. It contains practical examples and mini applications that explore different concepts and patterns such as the use of **Proxy**, **Reflect**, **Option API**, and **Composition API**.

## Project Structure

### 1. `proxy_example`
Examples of how to use the `Proxy` class in JavaScript, which is one of the foundational concepts of reactivity in Vue 3.

### 2. `reflect_example`
Examples of how to use the `Reflect` class in JavaScript, complementing the work of `Proxy` in reactivity.

### 3. `options`
A mini ecommerce built using Vue 3's **Option API**.  
It covers concepts like:
- `data()`
- `watch()`

### 4. `composition`
A mini ecommerce built using Vue 3's **Composition API**.  
It covers concepts like:
- `ref()`
- `computed()`
- `reactive()`
- Components

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/vue3-learning-project.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd vue3-learning-project/composition
or
cd vue3-learning-project/options
```
3. Open the project folder in VSCode.
4. Install the Live Server extension in VSCode (if you don't have it already).
5. Right-click on index.html and select "Open with Live Server".
6. Your browser will open automatically with the project running at http://localhost:5500 (or another port).


## Technologies Used

- **Vue 3**: The main framework for building user interfaces.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Use of `Proxy` and `Reflect`.

## Next Steps

- Improve the visual design of the applications.
- Add more practical examples for both Option API and Composition API.
- Include unit tests for each of the components.
